# Employee API #

The Employee API is a RESTful API to get information from each employee.  The information includes:

* Background information
* Skill Ratings (protected access)
* Current and past projects
* Deparment information
* Virtual Team (V-Team) information

## Framework ##

* NodeJS + Express + Mongoose + MongoDB <http://localhost:28017/>
* JSONP compatible

## Security ##

* Authentication required for skills: login and auto-expiring keys
* Passwords are Bcrypted (Hash + Salt) before storing
* IP Whitelisting (if necessary) [List of IPs](https://wiki.intra.sears.com/confluence/display/ECOMMIT/Do+Not+Shun+for+InfoProt)
* Password Protection for skill ratings

## To Do ##

* Change all .updates from Model.update(query, { name: 'jason borne' }, options, callback) to Model.update(query, { $set: { name: 'jason borne' }}, options, callback)
* Change all the Mongoose find() to use lean()
* Add ability to add tags to users and vteams.  Structure name:ASAP members:[users,vteams]
* Org chart functionality: who is your manager, who are your direct reports

sudo mkdir -p /data/db
sudo chown `id -u` /data/db
````

## How to Create a Database ##
